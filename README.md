### Hello there, I'm NuvinðŸ‘‹

A 21-year-old graduate software engineer from the [Uni of Westminster](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/) based in Colombo, Sri Lanka ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡° building amazing tech @ [iTelaSoft](https://www.itelasoft.com.au/) since 2021.

Harnessing the power of the quantum phenomenon to accelerate computational capabilities fascinates me ðŸ¤©, paving my research focus into quantum-ML & cryptography (Find my research on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nuvin_Godakanda_Arachchi)). I also love building full-stack tech from its core logical backend to the fun & interactive interfaces that can positively impact the world âœ¨.

Check out <b>[my portfolio](https://nuvinga.github.io) or my repositories </b> to find some exciting open-source contributions I've made. Who knows, maybe you will even find a way to contribute and help make things even better ðŸ˜‰.

Bye now!
